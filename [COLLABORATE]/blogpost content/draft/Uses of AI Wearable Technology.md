# Usage of AI Wearable Technology
  
### I. AI Wearable Technology and Productivity in the Workplace <br>
<p align="Justify">While these accessories obviously sound promising and help with daily human activities, these wearable assistants can also improve employees’ performance and productivity (Belletier, et. al, 2021; Kuratomi, 2023;
Khakurel, 2017). According to Belletier, et. al (2021), wearable technology assistants can eventually help a person’s cognitive limitations which can increase their ability to work simultaneously. For instance, a person’s “working memory” or the way we process and store information (p.105) can slow down their cognitive ability in situations where employees need to multitask which can lead to confusion and interfering thoughts. With the help of these wearable assistants, employees can get to perform tasks without worrying about cognitive constraints as well as the entry of information in the workplace. <br>

### II. Examples of wearable technology applied in the workplace: (Nahavandi, 2022)
<p align="Justify">
    <b>1. WearIT@work project (in Skoda Auto car Manufacturing)</b><br>
        A wearable device consisting of a belt computer and a head-mounted display was created to replace traditional paper-based car quality assurance performed at the end of the assembly line. This was also created for the workers to be able to use it even without training.
        Problem – battery life, since workers will use it at normal working hours, thus, these wearable devices need to be useable for that amount of time.
<br><br>
    <b>2. Carnegie Mellon University (CMU)’s “Navigator 2”</b><br>
        This research and creation of wearable devices was used to lessen inspection time for mobile workers. 
        The creation of this wearable device has reduced the inspection time to 50%.
        Main challenges – interface design, cognitive model, contextual awareness, and adaptation to tasks being performed (p.14)
<br><br>
    <b>3. Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech) Order Picking Wearable Device </b><br>
        This device has helped workers in efficient order picking and could also help in preventing possible human errors.
        Challenge – wearability of head-mounted displays and optimization of decision-making for mobile workers through wearable computing. (p.14)

### III. Other Noteworthy AI Wearable Technology Uses in Various Fields
*There have been several cutting-edge AI-powered wearables in the market that have been making noises ever since the integration was introduced. Below are some of the noteworthy devices that are currently accessible in the market:*

- **Whoop 4.0** -  an AI wearable fitness tracker that gives insights and biometric tracking with the help of biometric sensors
- **Apollo Neuro** - an AI wearable developed mainly for stress and sleep management and operates with the help of vibration frequencies
- **Oura Smart Ring** - an AI powered ring which uses different sensors and accelerometers that helps in providing body insights
- **Pavlok 3** - a wearable designed to operate with electrical impulses. It mainly uses the concept of aversive therapy.
- **Yopi** (Your Online Personal Instructor) -  a wrist wearable device utilizing AI in measuring oxygen consumption. It aims to spot early indicators of health problems.
- **Rewind Pendant** - an AI integrated pendant that functions with AI voice-to-text technology
- **Humane Ai Pin** - a relatively new wearable that can give various forms of information with the help of AI
    
### IV. The Fields That Would Benefit From AI Wearable Technology 

*Nahavandi (2022) listed different areas in which AI wearable technology can benefit from, these includes areas in:*

  **Sports** – players can avoid potential injuries arising from heat stroke, for example. AI wearable devices can monitor a player’s vitals and maintain a balanced body temperature.
  
  **Healthcare and health status monitoring** – AI wearable technologies can monitor blood pressure, heart rate, etc.
  
  **Fitness** – wearable devices can track “fitness-related activities” (p.10) and motivate the user to be healthy, keeping in mind that measurements are not always accurate.
  
  **Mental health** – wearable devices are said to be useful in determining human physiology status based on collected data such as “heartbeat, blood pressure, body temperature, or ECG (p.13)”
  
  **Helping with movement disorders** – this can be used in assisting stroke patients in the movement of hips and knees, for instance.
  
  **Autism** – previous wearable technology devices were created to improve autistic children in emotion recognition as well as stereotypical motor movements (SMMs) (p.13) for decision-making.
